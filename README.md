Next, Professor Harpreet Kaur delivered a heartfelt session, emphasizing the importance of “P” in life — Patience, Prayer, Placement, and Progress — encouraging us to grow with purpose. She was followed by the Chief Engineer of the Municipal Corporation, who highlighted how engineering is shaping real-world change, especially in Ludhiana.

We also saw motivational videos from two college alumni, one now at Airtel and another in a leading industry, sharing how Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College built their careers. A finance professor then explained easy ways to get study loans without collateral, which was both practical and reassuring.

The day ended at the CSE block, where our mentors, HOD, placement head, and activities coordinator welcomed us warmly and shared insights about our journey ahead. It truly felt like the beginning of something special.

DAY 2 : 1st August, 2025

The second day of our induction began with a Proficiency Test in English and Mathematics, helping the faculty assess our current skill levels and identify areas for improvement. Following this, we gathered in the auditorium for an insightful expert lecture by Dr. Arshdeep Singh on “Food: A Pivot Role in Students’ Overall Wellness.” He shared fascinating facts about nutrition and cautioned us, especially young students, about the risks of frequent outside eating, urging mindful and healthy habits for long-term well-being.
